```{r}
accounts <- read.csv("data/accounts_analytical.csv")

df <- accounts[complete.cases(accounts[ , 'loan_term']),]

logit <- glm(loan_status ~ as.numeric(acct_creation_date)+loan_amount+loan_payment+loan_term, data = df, family = "binomial")
summary(logit)
```

The regression seems that there is almost no relationship between open date and loan default. Let's see the plot below. Red points shows FALSE for the plot.

```{r}
df$co <- rep(3, nrow(df))
df <- within(df, co[loan_default == TRUE] <- 2)

plot(df$account_id, as.numeric(df$acct_creation_date), pch = 19, col=df$co)
```
