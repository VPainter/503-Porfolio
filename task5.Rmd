```{r}
accounts <- read.csv("data/accounts_analytical.csv")
transactions <- read.csv("data/transactions.csv")

df <- transactions[transactions$type == 'credit',]

accounts$credit_transactions <- rep(FALSE, nrow(accounts))

j = 1
for(i in 1:nrow(df)){
  while(df$account_id[i] > accounts$account_id[j]){j = j+1}
  if(df$account_id[i] == accounts$account_id[j]){
    accounts$credit_transactions[j] = TRUE
  }
}

accounts$ccholds <- rep(FALSE, nrow(accounts))

for(i in 1:nrow(accounts)){
  if(!is.na(accounts$credit_cards[i])){accounts$ccholds[i] = TRUE}
}


table(accounts$ccholds, accounts$credit_transactions)
```

We can see that there are a lot of accounts has no cards but still performs credit transactions. There are also 44 accounts with credit cards but having no credit transactions.
